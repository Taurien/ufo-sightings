# UFO Sightings üõ∏

Based on a dataset of UFO reports originally compiled by the [National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)](https://nuforc.org/) and later made publicly accessible by a third party on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) (last updated in 2019), I set out to build an interactive platform where these sightings can be **searched, filtered, and visualized** on Google Maps.

This dataset contains sightings that can be filtered by country:

| Country                | Sightings |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| United States (**us**) | 65.114    |
| Canada (**ca**)        | 3.000     |
| Great Britain (**gb**) | 1.905     |
| Australia (**au**)     | 538       |
| Deutschland (**de**)   | 105       |

To power this project, I downloaded the CSV file and hosted it in **MongoDB** to allow dynamic queries and efficient retrieval of data through an API.

## API Reference

### Get UFO's
```http
  GET /api/ufo-locations?country=<value>&state=<value>&year=<value>&shape=<value>&limit=<value>
```

* All parameters are optional, but it is **required** to pass **at least one filter** to make a request and retrieve sightings.
Accepted filters: **country** || **state** || **year || **shape**

```http
  GET /api/ufo-locations?shape=<value>
```

* `limit` defaults to **10** if not provided.
* Each request returns **random UFO sightings** based on the applied filters.

### Demo

https://ufo-sightings-taurien.vercel.app/api/ufo-locations?country=us&state=wi&year=2004&shape=light&limit=30

This request asks for **30 UFO sightings** in the **US (Wisconsin)** during **2004** with a **light** shape. However, only **14 sightings** were actually recorded, so that‚Äôs all the API returns.
