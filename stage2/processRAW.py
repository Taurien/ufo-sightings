Been seeing UFOs for 5-years, never anything like this. My brother in law is leaving 11:30 pm 9/13/05, from visit today. Told him were gonna walk outside & casually scan the skies for the lights/ufos I have been seeing. Dont let them know you see them because they seem to know and will take off. Didnt see what I usually see. Were standing there talking and said, "theres plane." Then the "plane" turned & starting coming back towards high in the sky. Then the craft started jerking every which way. It looked like it was sky-writing in cursive in tight jerky motions, then it would go up and down, back and forth, within a tight small area, then it might fly a second then start again with jerking around every which. By this my brother in law and I are dumbfounded. What is it doing? How is it doing this? Is this something of Elon Musks? This is not a drone, not a satellite, dont think it starlink of any kind. Its moving in crazy ways. I go get phone to attempt to videotape. My camera cant see lights that far up in the sky. We are watching & watching & confused. He is about to leave and I see another one in sky to my right and at same he is seeing another one off to his left & we still see the original one. The additional ones we see are doing same weird motions. Then I saw another one, he sees another one. I saw at least 6. I had to quit looking because this is scaring me bad. I said I have to go in, I cant handle. I am scared. I am going to be here alone and these things are in sky above me. I am sure they are out there right now still doing whatever they are doing. Brother in law left, takes him 45 minutes to get home. Someone needs to explain this to me and dont tell me they dont know what Im talking about because they damn sure do know! I have been trying this since I came inside this mobile home. I hope this goes through.',
